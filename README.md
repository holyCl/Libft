## libft - recoding of some standard LibC functions

### Short Introduction:

C programming can be very tedious when one doesnâ€™t have access to those highly useful standard functions.
This project is about to take the time to re-write those functions, understand them, and learn to use them.
This library is useful for all the future C projects in 42 school curriculum.

Please find more information according this project [here](https://github.com/HolyCl/Libft/blob/master/libft.en.pdf).

### How To Launch And Test:

First clone git repository (type in console):
```

git clone https://github.com/HolyCl/Libft.git

```

Than go to the project folder and compile library:
```

cd libft

make

```

Now you can test it with your own C programs. For this you just need to include libft header in your project (#include "./libft/libft.h");

Than compile this library with your code:
```

gcc [your files] libft.a

```
